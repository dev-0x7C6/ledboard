# Cool, what is this about?

This is my own implementation of ws2812b led strip for avr microcontroller and animation framework. You can modify source and generate your own animations. In theory this should be easly portable to other architectures but build system is focused on avr for now.

### Techniques and C++20

This is also my playground for testing upcomming C++20 features and develop my metaprogramming skills. I'm aiming for very generic code and clever techniques to achieve very small code footprint (zero overhead abstraction). If you have some ideas how to improve code, please let me know.

### My use case

I'm using this project for driving my skateboard led strip, so skateboard unique features my come in future.
